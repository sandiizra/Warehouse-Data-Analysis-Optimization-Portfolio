# Warehouse Data Analysis & Optimization

**Author:** Sandi Izra  
**Role Target:** Warehouse Analyst Intern â€” GE Vernova  
**Tools Used:** Excel | Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) | Power BI

## Project Overview
This project simulates warehouse operational data analysis to evaluate stock accuracy, space utilization, and process efficiency.
The objective is to demonstrate how data analytics can support warehouse improvement projects and decision-making for management.

## Dataset
- `warehouse_data.xlsx` â€” simulated 500-row dataset including inbound, outbound, current stock, zone, and discrepancy columns.

## How to run
1. Open `warehouse_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Install required packages: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `openpyxl`.
3. Run the notebook cells to reproduce basic analysis and charts.

## Summary of Key Metrics (example)
- Average Utilization (approx): 74.9%
- Approx Discrepancy Rate: 0.42%

## Insights & Recommendations
- Rebalance stock across zones where utilization is imbalanced.
- Implement weekly stock audits on items with discrepancies.
- Relocate fast-moving items closer to the outbound area to reduce picking time.
